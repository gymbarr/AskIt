# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# FactoryBot.create_list(:category, 10)

# all_categories = Category.all

# 10.times do
#   user = User.all.sample

#   categories = all_categories.sample(1 + rand(all_categories.count))
#   FactoryBot.create(:question, user: user, categories: categories)
# end

# 50.times do
#   question = Question.all.sample
#   user = User.all.sample

#   FactoryBot.create(:answer, repliable: question, user: user)
# end

# 20.times do
#   answer = Answer.all.sample
#   user = User.all.sample

#   FactoryBot.create(:comment, repliable: answer, parent: answer, user: user)
# end

# 20.times do
#   comment = Comment.all.sample
#   user = User.all.sample

#   FactoryBot.create(:comment, :for_comment, repliable: comment, parent: comment, user: user)
